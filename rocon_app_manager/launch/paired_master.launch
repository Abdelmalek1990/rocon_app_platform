    While it might be intuitive to run the zeroconf publisher here in the public master
    it is better to have that component in the private master:
    
    1) private master's app manager usually needs zeroconf for hub discovery
        -> no need to double up on nodes in the same system
    2) we can make use of app manager's robot name arg.

  <!--
    The public gateway does not use zeroconf, it needs to know where it can find the internal
    hub shared by private and public ros masters.
